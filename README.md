# CBIS-DDSM-DATASET
Suppose you want to train a breast cancer classifier or a segmentation model using the CBIS-DDSM dataset. In that case, this repository may help you to easily extract the mammograms and the masks from the original folder.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the Dataset

You can download the dataset directly from the [official TCIA page](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22516629).

#### a. Install the NBIA Data Retriever

To download the dataset, you‚Äôll need the **NBIA Data Retriever**, a tool provided by TCIA:

- [Click here to download NBIA Data Retriever](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/Version+4.4.3)

#### b. Ubuntu Linux Installation Guide

As an Ubuntu Linux user, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to installing the NBIA Data Retriever and then the dataset:

1. [Download the `.deb` installer](https://github.com/CBIIT/NBIA-TCIA/releases/download/DR-4_4_3-TCIA-20240916-1/nbia-data-retriever_4.4.3-1_amd64.deb) to your computer.

2. Open a terminal, navigate to the download directory, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i nbia-data-retriever_4.4.3-1_amd64.deb

    ``` 

   üí°  Take into account that you should replace _nbia-data-retriever_4.4.3-1_amd64.deb_ by the actual name of the installer you downloaded before.

3. [Download the `.tcia` file](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/wp-content/uploads/CBIS-DDSM-All-doiJNLP-zzWs5zfZ.tcia) that contains the mammograms to your computer.
4. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the .tcia file, and run the following command:

5.  ```bash
   
    /opt/nbia-data-retriever/bin/nbia-data-retriever --cli CBIS-DDSM-All-doiJNLP-zzWs5zfZ.tcia

    ```
   üìÅ This command will begin downloading the dataset into folders containing the mammogram images and masks. If your .tcia file has a different name, update the command accordingly.

### Additional information 
To go into detail about the CBIS-DDSM dataset, you can check this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177). It describes how to use the dataset and how the dataset was built. 

## Quantitative Description

Despite the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177) stating that CBIDS-DDSM has 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, it is difficult to determine how many images this dataset has. According to the metadata provided in the CSV files, CBIS-DDSM contains 3103 mammograms, 465 of which have more than one abnormality. 2.458 (79.21%) of the mammograms belong to the training set, and 645 (20.79% ) belong to the test set. Furthermore, the dataset includes 3,568 cropped mammograms along with their corresponding masks, which provide pixel-level annotations of abnormalities as identified by a radiologist.

## A bit of explanation of the repository's functions
### Mammograms_code.ipynb:
This script contains a function that retrieves the path of all mammograms on your local machine and merges each image path with its pathology in a data frame. The dataframe is subsequently saved as a CSV file. 
### mask_code.ipynb:
This script contains a function that retrieves the path of all patches in your local machine and then merges each mask path with its pathology in a data frame. This dataframe is subsequently  saved as CSV file. Note: There are more masks than mammograms since some mammograms have more than one lesion.

### convert_dicom.ipynb:
The  images provided by CBIS-DDSM  (mammograms, masks, and crops of abnormalities)  are saved in DICOM format. This function saves a 16-bit mammogram from DICOM as a rescaled 16-bit PNG file.

### Original_Split.ipynb:

This script creates the test and training set according to the standardized split given by the official [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017177). The path of all images is stored in a data frame, which is saved as a CSV file.

### Bonus :
In this [repository](https://github.com/sposso/Deep_learning_to_improve_breast_Cancer_pytorch), I implemented the deep learning classifier introduced in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48995-4) "Deep Learning to Improve Breast Cancer Detection on Screening Mammography" using PyTorch and CBIS-DDSM dataset.  The original code and model are available [here](https://github.com/lishen/end2end-all-conv). However, this  code is in Keras.  
My  main goal is to provide an understandable implementation of this model, which can be helpful for everyone, especially those who are beginning to work with deep learning and are interested in medical applications.
